'''
When Python sees a statement like
for x in foo it will actually call iter(foo). The iter built-in
function calls the foo.__iter__ special method in turn. The __iter__
method must return an iterator object (which itself implements the
63__next__ special method). Then the for loop repeatedly calls the next
built-in function on the iterator object until itâ€™s exhausted (and raises a
StopIteration exception).

'''

'''
The protocol
states that when an iterator is passed to the iter built-in function, iter will
return the iterator itself. In contrast, when a container type is passed to iter,
a new iterator object will be returned each time
