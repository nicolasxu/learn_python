'''


Python can work around all these issues with coroutines. 

Coroutines let you have many seemingly simultaneous 
functions in your Python programs. They’re implemented as 
an extension to generators 


The cost of starting a generator coroutine is a function call. 
Once active, they each use less than 1 KB of memory until they’re exhausted.
